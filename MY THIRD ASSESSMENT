MY THIRD ASSESSMENT â€“ MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT CLASS A - SEAT NO. 16 (0076)

Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.
For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
Answer:
fun main(){
   var number : Int = 0
    for (number in 1..100) {
        // number divisible by 3 and 5 will
        // always be divisible by 15, print
        // 'FizzBuzz' in place of the number
        if (number%15 == 0)
            println("FizzBuzz")

        // number divisible by 3? print 'Fizz'
        // in place of the number
        else if ((number%3) == 0)
            println("Fizz")

        // number divisible by 5, print 'Buzz'
        // in place of the number
        else if ((number%5) == 0)
            println("Buzz")

        else // print the number
            println(number)

    }
return

}

Write a short program that prints the reverse of a string that is supplied.
You can assume that the string passed will never be empty or null.
When given the string "Good food", the output should be "doof dooG".
Answer:
fun main() {

    val String =""
    var result: String = "Good Food"
    var lastIndex = String.lastIndex // last index of the string and store it in variable

    while (lastIndex >= 0) {
        result += String[lastIndex]
        lastIndex--
    }

    println("Reversed: ${result.reversed()}")
       }
